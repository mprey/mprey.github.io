As of writing, I am a quantiative developer at a hedge fund -- I make no promises to keep this sentence up to date.
Previously, I've worked as a software engineer for Amazon and PlayStation, and an indepedent contractor.
I've been programming for as long as I can remember as cliche as that may sound.

I got involved in programming originally through modding video games. I was fairly active in the Minecraft
development community pre-college (2017) which sparked my interest in Java. I found quantiative development sometime
in college and it has kept my interest since.

I've done things with web development, large-scale system design, embedded programming, AI/ML, low-latency software
design, devops, video game development, mobile development, kernel programming. I like to
approach software with a jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none mindset. I suppose we'll find out how this pays off
later in my career.

I stay busy outside of the computer playing pool (mostly 8ball, sometimes 9ball), reading (mostly fantasy/fiction/
sci-fi), exploring new hobbies, and spending time with friends.

Send me an e-mail and let's connect. There *should* be an e-mail icon somewhere on this page...
